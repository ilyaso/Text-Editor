	/* This function displays the C-style, null-terminated string pointed to by str, 

	starting at row row and column col of the console screen in a field of fieldLen characters. 



	Row value 0 refers to the top row, and column value 0 refers to the left-most column.  

	If the string is longer than fieldLen, your function displays the first fieldLen characters.  

	If the string is shorter than fieldLen, your function displays the portion of the entire 

	string that fits on the screen, followed by enough trailing spaces to fill out the field completely. 

	If fieldLen is 0 or less, your function displays the portion of the entire string that fits on the

	screen with no trailing spaces.



	Your function positions the cursor after the last character displayed, but excluding any

	added trailing spaces, if the last character is not in the last column of the screen; 

	otherwise, your function positions the cursor under the last character on the screen.  

	Your function does not flush the output buffer.  The results are undefined if the starting

	position of the string is not within the dimensions of the screen.
